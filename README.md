# React Basic

This is a repository to demonstrate some basic use cases for React.

**Special Thanks** to [@Harper](https://github.com/Harper04) for his guidance and help with the major problem of this boilerplate.


## Getting started

* Install Node8
* Install npm
* Run `npm i -g webpack-cli webpack` to install webpack globally

## Basics

* Run `git checkout tags/basic`
* You see a single component `src/components/Hello.tsx`
* `src/index.tsx` loads `Hello.tsx` and puts it into the container `example`
* The container `<div id="example" />` can be found in `index.html`
* To run the page just use `npm run build` and open the `index.html` in a browser
